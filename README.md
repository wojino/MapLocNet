# MapLocNet: Coarse-to-Fine Feature Registration for Visual Re-Localization in Navigation Maps

This repository contains the implementation of **MapLocNet**, a transformer-based neural localization network proposed in the paper:

**"MapLocNet: Coarse-to-Fine Feature Registration for Visual Re-Localization in Navigation Maps"**  
*(Authors: Hang Wu et al.)*

This work is focused on reproducing and understanding the methods proposed in the original paper by implementing the network architecture, training pipeline, and evaluation protocols.
